This program stores a giant picture of an apple logo with windows xp overtop of it, and is used as a sprite later on in the program. The jpeg data is encoded in hexidecimal into the qb64 program, and recreated as a binary file temporarily to run the program, along with an mp3 that simultaneously plays while the large apple/xp sprite is bouncing around the screen. The music takes significantly longer to load because there is more data, so a brief routine to speed up, show current position, and ease the user while waiting has been added. This is merely a demonstration of the more complex things that can be done using QB64. This will work fine under linux, however you will have to change the windows file structure format to the linux file format under this source code. If it did understand what the windows call was doing, it would probably not have permission on a linux system to write to ./ unless you were on sudo or a true root. Enjoy! :) -James
